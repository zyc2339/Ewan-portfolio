        In 2021 I began my journey to become a world-class developer, through
        extensive hours of learning, I gained hands-on experience. I now have a
        portfolio of web applications I have created. These projects are a
        product of my continuous development within design and programming.

      <p>A little bit about me:</p>

        {" "}
        I am addicted to catsüòª. If you see me looking zoned out - yes, I am
        thinking of cats. In my free time, you can find me at the gymüèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, at the
        beachüåä or on the way to some explore nature on some bush tracksüå≥.

      <h3>TEAM WORK & CONFLICT MANAGEMENT</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout my work experience and studies at Mission Ready HQ I
        completed a variety of group projects, of which most were one week
        projects using the Agile framework. I colaborated extremely well with my
        teammates (3-4 people) and I was always checking up on other members
        making sure they were OK and that we were all on the same page in terms
        of the task and application MVP. <br />
        <br />
        In my customer facing role at Spark conflict management is key. I
        believe most conflicts are misunderstandings that can be managed with
        good communication. My experience has helped me become a great listener
        with empathy and compassion for others.

      <h3>PROBLEM SOLVER & WILLING TO LEARN</h3>
      <p>
        Since embarking on my journey to a career in web development I have been
        introduced to new ways of problem-solving. My Google skills have been
        refined and I have learned to research and read technical documentation.
        During the reserch, I always find something interesting: new tools, new
        library, new concepts. I love to try them out by applying them in my
        project and mark them in my Notion and Typora.
      </p>

      <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
      <p>
        As the building blocks of web applications I was able to design, build
        and style a personal blog. This was made responsive using CSS media
        queries. What I found most rewarding was the end to end process -
        ideation to creation.
      </p>
      <h3>React JS & JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        The majority of my projects have been built using React JS and I am most
        comfortable using this library to create clean functional applications.
        My React projects are described in further detail in my portfolio page.
      </p>
      <h3>REST API & MongoDB</h3>
      <p>
        Working with Rest API's was a particularly fun project at Developers
        Institute. I created a restaurant booking web app which can be found{" "}
