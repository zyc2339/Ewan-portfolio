        I initially began my journey in becoming a developer last year where I
        delved into some hands-on experience through extensive hours of
        learning. I now have a portfolio of web applications I have created.
        These projects have helped to enhance my design and programming skills.

        thinking of cats.

        way to some tracks🌳 I've never been.
